# Financial Market Simulation

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that simulates financial markets using Python. The notebook, "01_financial_market_simulation.ipynb", provides a comprehensive guide to modeling and analyzing financial data, aiming to offer insights into market behavior and investment strategies.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Utilizes `pandas` for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numerical Computation**: Employs `numpy` for high-level mathematical functions.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Leverages `scipy.stats` for statistical operations.
- **Data Visualization**: Uses `matplotlib` for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Financial Data**: Fetches real-time financial data using `yfinance`, allowing for practical market simulation scenarios.

## Prerequisites
To run the notebook, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `yfinance`

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install matplotlib pandas numpy scipy yfinance
```
